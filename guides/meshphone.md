# Meshphone
The KCMesh MeshPhone network is run on a Grandstream UCM6202 IP PBX by KD0VXN.  Chuck's contact information can be found on the [Resources](/resources) page.

The KCMesh Meshphone network can be accessed with most SIP phones or applications.

Because the SIP traffic runs on a Grandstream brand PBX controller, the easiest setup and support will be available to users of Grandstream branded phones.

Email Chuck to request access to this SIP network.
